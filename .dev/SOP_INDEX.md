# Standard operating procedure index

This index points to canonical sources. Read the document before invoking its
executable owner. Upstream merge proposals run outside GitHub CI through a
machine-local HappyHerd automation; ordinary component deployment does not
impose that source-state gate.

HappyHerd guidance owns this distribution's lineage, branch, patch,
component-deployment, public-release, and verification policy.
