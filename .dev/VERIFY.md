# Verification matrix

Run root commands from the repository root and package commands from `server/`.
Choose checks from the changed contract, not from file extension alone.

## Toolchain and installation

Root CI defines the supported verification toolchain:

```bash
node --version       # Node 20
pnpm --version       # pnpm 10.11.0
bun --version        # Bun 1.3.11
command -v shellcheck
```

Prove the lockfile is reproducible:

```bash
cd server
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
cd ..
git diff --exit-code
```

## Cheap checks during every iteration

```bash
git diff --check
node scripts/lint-source.mjs
git status --short
```

`lint-source.mjs` scans changed and untracked source for conflict markers,
invalid JSON, and whitespace errors. It is not ESLint and it is not a formatter.

Prefer a focused Vitest file and the owning package's typecheck while iterating:

```bash
cd server
pnpm --filter happy-app exec vitest run sources/path/example.test.ts
pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli exec vitest run --project unit src/path/example.test.ts
pnpm --filter ./packages/happy-server exec vitest run sources/path/example.test.ts
```

## Targeted bundles

Commands in this table run from `server/` unless they start with `scripts/` or
`node scripts/`, which run from the repository root.

| Changed surface | Required targeted checks |
|---|---|
| `.dev` context or HappyHerd skill catalog | Run `git diff --check` and `node scripts/lint-source.mjs`. Validate every changed skill with the installed `skill-creator` `quick_validate.py`; resolve every relative Markdown link from its containing file. When the safeguard skill changes, require `diff -ru .dev/skills/happyherd-user-safeguard server/packages/happy-cli/skills/happyherd-user-safeguard`. When a selective Claude/Codex reinstall is authorized, compare every installed HappyHerd skill with `.dev/skills` and prove an allowlist-excluding fingerprint of every unrelated installed skill is identical before and after. |
| App logic | `pnpm --filter happy-app typecheck`; `pnpm --filter happy-app test --run` |
| Provider registry, Agent Defaults, or launch-mode propagation | Focus `sources/sync/agentDefaults.test.ts`, `sources/sync/settings.spec.ts`, `sources/app/(app)/settings/agents.test.ts`, `sources/app/(app)/new/index.launch.test.ts`, `sources/components/modelModeOptions.test.ts`, `sources/hooks/useNewSessionDraft.test.ts`, `sources/hooks/useStartSessionFromDraft.test.ts`, and `sources/utils/newSessionModeSelection.test.ts`; prove active-registry parity, every active provider group, explicit capability-source selection and unavailable states, selected exact-machine catalog ownership, independent provider keys, every cross-provider draft reset, empty unsupported dimensions, Rig spawn payloads in both launchers, and post-await GrokBuild/Rig revalidation; then run the full app checks |
| New provider or provider protocol behavior | Follow [the provider-onboarding playbook](playbooks/provider-onboarding.md). Prove arbitrary provider-native mode transit through wire, app, and CLI admission; exact-daemon validation and launch arguments; every advertised permission mode's callback behavior; raw/spec-shaped text, thinking, tool start/update/result/error mapping; stable call correlation; and meaningful generic app rendering. Add the missing focused fixture at the owning boundary, then run wire plus affected CLI/app package checks. Run a live provider smoke when its external prerequisites are available; argv proof alone is insufficient. |
| Named credential pool, quota attribution, or reactive rotation | Read [the credential-pool playbook](playbooks/credential-pools.md), including its native verification boundary. Also run `src/credentialPool/{codexAuth,runtimeAuthOwnership}.test.ts`, `src/commands/connect.credentialFiles.test.ts`, `src/codex/codexAppServerClient.test.ts`, `src/utils/createSessionMetadata.test.ts`, and `src/resume/handleResumeCommand.test.ts`. Focus CLI `src/commands/connect.accounts.test.ts`, `src/claude/{runClaude,claudeRemote}.test.ts`, `src/claude/utils/usageLimits.test.ts`, `src/credentialPool/{providerLimits,providerLimitNotice,rotation}.test.ts`, `src/agent/acp/runAcp.test.ts`, `src/daemon/{controlServer.providerLimit,run.resume}.test.ts`, and `src/api/{api,apiSession}.test.ts`; focus app `sources/sync/{storageTypes,typesRaw}.spec.ts`, `sources/sync/reducer/reducer.spec.ts`, `sources/components/MessageView.test.ts`, and `sources/text/index.test.ts`. Prove malformed connect arguments have no authentication side effects; setup-token redraws collapse without losing interaction; named-account quota is cleared before the replacement loop and never merges across accounts; stale ID/version notices remain retryable while accepted duplicates dedupe; overlapping Codex/Grok A/B activations cannot write the current runtime auth back to the older account, Codex reconnect refuses mismatched runtime ownership, and Grok resumes from its recorded nondefault `GROK_HOME`; every rejected typed window and narrow provider fallback reports while warnings do not; a usable alternate resumes the same Happy session before one stable switch event persists without an exhaustion event; no usable alternate, unmanaged providers, and rotation failures persist one provider-named quota exhaustion event; and en/cn/de render provider and account names byte-faithfully. Then run full Happy CLI/app typechecks and tests plus `i18n:check`. |
| Credentials & Accounts management | Focus wire `credentialManager`; server `credentialRoutes`; CLI credential-pool `store`, `loginManager`, `activate`, `apiMachine.credentials`, and `sessionEnvironment`; app `apiCredentials`, `credentialOps`, `SettingsView`, and `CredentialsSettingsView` browser tests. Prove account and credential persistence, machine/provider/user isolation, default/rename/remove semantics, login pending/cancel/error/retry/stale-response behavior, and masked/reveal behavior with secret-free lists and logs. Render 1440×900, 390×844, and 360×800 in light and dark themes, then run full wire/server/CLI/app checks, i18n, UI inventory, changelog parsing, and production Web export. |
| UI, routes, or localized copy | App checks plus `pnpm --filter happy-app i18n:check` |
| Interactive UI behavior | Exercise the actual gesture through the rendered production component and its real host at applicable Web Desktop and Web Mobile widths. Assert the visible state transition and user outcome; direct prop invocation, source or bundle strings, builds, exports, and unit tests alone do not prove interaction. |
| Cross-provider session continuation | Focus app `providerContinuation`, `ProviderContinuationSheet`, and `useSessionQuickActions`; CLI `apiMachine.codexFork`, `createSessionMetadata`, and `run.resume`. Render the `SessionActionsPopover` → provider picker → spawn/send/navigation gesture at 1440×900 and 390×844. Prove a fresh target provider with the exact source machine/path/worktree/Commander, bounded recent visible text through the ordinary encrypted send, bidirectional links, and no provider-native resume; then run app/CLI typechecks and tests, UI inventory, `i18n:check`, and production web export. |
| Catalog keys/placeholders | First `pnpm --filter happy-app i18n:generate`, review generated changes, then `i18n:check` |
| Route or UI-owning module | First `pnpm --filter happy-app ui:inventory:generate`, review generated changes, then `i18n:check` |
| Named project sessions, list views, or sidebar navigation | `projectSessionList` unit tests, `storage.projects`, `sessionListGrouping` and `settings`, `projectsSuperSession.browser` tests at 1440x900/390x844, navigation and persisted setting validation, app typecheck, i18n inventory, and export smoke tests. Keep live authenticated proof separate from rendered fixtures. |
| Session Info Changes and synced bot presentation/lifecycle | Focus `sources/app/(app)/session/[id]/info.archive.test.ts`, `sources/utils/sessionInfoChangesNavigation.test.ts`, `sources/-session/SessionView.sideChat.test.ts`, `sources/components/{projectsSuperSession,sideChatHeader}.browser.test.ts`, `sources/sync/{storage.bots,ops.sessionArchive}.test.ts`, `sources/sync/agentSessionPlaces.spec.ts`, and `sources/hooks/useSessionQuickActions.test.ts`. Prove same route key, composer and dirty state across desktop/mobile Info → Changes, repeat/focus handoff, Super Session first once, grouped bot lexical ordering versus flat activity order, and bot RPC archive failure/retry without server fallback, cleanup, or deletion. Machine-synced lifecycle owns final archive. Then run app/wire tests and typechecks, UI inventory, `i18n:check`, and production Web export; live bot-publisher proof remains separate. |
| Active-session composer voice dictation | Focus `sources/-session/SessionView.sideChat.test.ts`, `sources/hooks/voiceDictationContract.test.ts`, and `sources/components/agentInputPrimaryAction.test.ts`; prove `.available` gating, recording/transcribing/cancel/error/retry wiring, append to an existing editable unsent draft, `/v1/voice/transcriptions` transport, no `/v1/voice/conversations` start, and the live-text type-then-tap guard; then run the full app checks and production web export. |
| Wire protocol | `pnpm --filter @slopus/happy-wire test`, then affected app/CLI/agent/server consumers |
| Happy CLI/provider/session logic | `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli typecheck`; `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli test` |
| Automations | Run wire tests; focused CLI service/store/command tests; focused app form/detail/list tests; then affected wire, CLI, and app typechecks/tests plus `i18n:check`. Provider-agent rails use the provider smoke in `playbooks/automation-unattended-smoke.md`; exec must prove strict fixed-command validation, completed/failed `execution: "exec"` history with `sessionId: null`, zero provider-session spawns, and list/detail/history readback. |
| Side-chat app presentation | Focus `sources/-session/SessionView.sideChat.test.ts`, `sources/components/{SideChatPanel,sideChatPresentation,sideChatHeader.browser}.test.ts`, and `sources/sync/{ops.codexFork,sideChatSessions,sessionListVisibility}.test.ts`; prove the persistent right-panel New side chat action at zero children, one-click creation with no fields, parent-only dedicated machine RPC submission, successful empty-child hydrate/focus/open with the normal composer, exact-parent filtering, newest-child focus, tab switching, stopped-child resume, archived hiding, non-destructive collapse, top-level-list exclusion, and that a retained background session cannot render or clear the foreground parent's panel. Exercise the real desktop `Side chats N` click-to-render gesture, child switching, second-click collapse, and the same narrow/mobile full-screen behavior; then run the full app checks and production web export. |
| Unified Workspace | Read [the Workspace playbook](playbooks/file-workspaces.md) first. Through the real rendered components, visibly click the shared `+` and its Changes, Workspace, and Attachments actions on Web Desktop and 390 × 844 Web Mobile for a Main Agent and active Side chat. Prove the single Workspace opens at the exact selected chat machine/cwd, browses the full machine without snapping back, and adds one existing file and directory to that exact chat context. Cover current-session file/directory/line-column/failed-read links, machine transport outside cwd, deduplicated tabs, Preview/Edit/Delete/feedback, dirty retention, 75/25 divider, and compact full-screen behavior. Prove rendered Markdown line navigation and the scriptless local HTML Preview remain unchanged. Then open an exact loopback URL on the selected chat machine, prove live scripts/styles/fetch state, machine-qualified URL identity, non-loopback rejection, element HTML/CSS/bounds plus cropped screenshot, and one existing feedback batch to the exact Main Agent or Side chat. Verify file and folder deletion, checking cancel, success, and error outcomes alongside same-machine tab closure, nested descendant cleanup, symlink rejection, and unsaved dirty-state warnings. Focus `desktopWorkspace.browser.test.ts`, `sideChatHeader.browser.test.ts`, `workspace/index.embedded.test.ts`, `DesktopFileWorkspace.test.ts`, `desktopFileWorkspaceModel.test.ts`, `SessionView.sideChat.test.ts`, `workspaceLive.test.ts`, and `workspaceFeedback.test.ts`; then run full app/wire/CLI tests and typechecks, UI inventory, `i18n:check`, production web export, and safe authenticated deployed proof. |
| Local side-chat delegation and lifecycle | Focus `src/commands/{machine,sideChat}.test.ts`, `src/api/{api,apiMachine.codexFork}.test.ts`, `src/daemon/{controlClient,controlServer.sideChat,sideChatLifecycle,run.resume}.test.ts`, the app's provider-native subagent and side-chat semantic tests, `packages/happy-server/sources/app/presence/sessionCache.spec.ts`, and `packages/happy-server/sources/app/api/routes/sessionRoutes.resume.spec.ts`; prove the Human app sends only `parentSessionId` through `happyherd-side-chat-create`, omits the brief, and records `deliver-brief` as skipped, while the Main Agent CLI rejects every create request missing any of its six non-empty brief fields and delivers a valid brief as the child's first ordinary encrypted queued message. Prove both enter the same daemon lifecycle, generic `spawn-happy-session` rejects `isSideChat` before provider launch, exact parent/child lineage, direct-child accountability, provider-native inline activity remains distinct from side-chat sessions, and a post-spawn CLI brief-delivery failure retains `parentSessionId`, `sessionId`, and the exact failed phase. Retain create/list/status/inspect/stop/pause/close/reopen/resume, sequential close-all partial receipts and sufficient client budget, active-but-unowned failure, committed-write/lost-ack reconciliation, durable post-restart discovery, exact remote read-back, authenticated resume suppression release, and immediate server reactivation. Then, without an account-control link, run the command sequence in `.dev/playbooks/side-chat-lifecycle.md` through `happyherd` and confirm no QR prompt, no stale active child, preserved lineage and CLI brief, a complete Worker Agent handoff, and nonzero exit for a failed JSON receipt. |
| Default persistent Assistant and local Commander creation | Focus CLI `src/{api,agentContext,daemon}/defaultAssistant.test.ts`, `src/commands/{machine.defaultAssistant,localSession}.test.ts`, `src/daemon/{controlClient.defaultAssistant,controlServer.defaultAssistant,run.resume}.test.ts`, and server `sessionRoutes.defaultAssistant.spec.ts`. Prove stable ID/key retry, one account entry across machines, retention beyond 150 sessions, existing definition preservation, first provider attachment, live registration ownership, and confirmed local settings/Commander without account-control auth. Then run full CLI/server checks and session continuity. |
| Session continuity across updates/restarts | `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli test:session-continuity` must include recent and older-than-14-day records, then run the Happy CLI typecheck/tests |
| Real provider/daemon/auth integration | `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli test:integration` when its external prerequisites are available |
| Public CLI and native installer | Run `scripts/test-public-launcher-release-contract.sh`. Build the current host target with `scripts/build-native-installer-asset.sh`, then run the actual archive test with `scripts/test-native-installer-asset.sh` to prove CLI execution, explicit remote selection, repeated-upgrade state preservation, localhost health, uninstall preservation, no customer Node/npm/pnpm/Bun/compiler usage, no build-time packaging metadata, and no musl-only package in glibc Linux assets. Run `node --check scripts/prepare-native-installer-deployment.mjs`, `node scripts/verify-cli-public-command.mjs`, `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli typecheck`, `pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli test`, and ShellCheck on changed installer scripts. Local evidence covers only the current host target; the four-target build/smoke matrix on the reviewed head owns platform proof, while tagged publication and a download from the published release own publication proof. |
| Agent runtime | `pnpm --filter happy-agent test`; `pnpm --filter @happyherd/happyherd-agent test` |
| Server | `pnpm --filter ./packages/happy-server typecheck`; `test`; `build` |
| Repository or deployment shell | `scripts/test-component-deployment-contract.sh`; nearest other `scripts/test-*-contract.sh`; `shellcheck -x` on changed shell files |
| Product identity | `node scripts/verify-product-identity.mjs` |
| Public boundary | `node scripts/test-public-boundary.mjs`; `node scripts/verify-public-boundary.mjs` |
| Lineage | `scripts/verify-lineage.sh` |
| Owned patch ledger | Unless every changed path is under `.dev/`, add the exact commit subject to `docs/owned-patches.tsv`; then run `scripts/verify-patch-discipline.sh` from a clean tree |

## Provider onboarding conformance

Every new provider, and every provider protocol-shape change, needs a
deterministic vertical-slice fixture. The minimum matrix is:

| Plane | Deterministic proof | Live proof when available |
|---|---|---|
| Capability ownership | Models, efforts, and permission modes come from the documented provider source; unsupported dimensions are empty | Catalog matches the installed provider version |
| Prompt admission | A provider-native mode not known to Claude or Codex survives wire, app, and CLI transit and reaches the provider boundary | One prompt reaches the selected provider |
| Launch/runtime selection | Exact native arguments or runtime selector; plan/build remains independent from permission policy; app and terminal resume resolve the latest synced permission/model/effort tuple with per-dimension launch-receipt and legacy-default fallbacks, the target daemon revalidates and launches it, and the app mirrors the returned receipt; invalid tuples fail rather than substitute; GrokBuild stays launch-receipt-owned except through its validated restart transition | Selected mode remains visible after a real resume |
| Permission callbacks | A synthetic late callback after startup and after resume prompts exactly once for interactive modes; allow-without-prompt selects only an advertised allow option; deny-without-prompt selects an advertised reject or cancels; neither non-interactive mode creates a pending request; unknown modes fail safe | Harmless calls show zero prompts and the documented allow/deny outcome in non-interactive modes, plus a prompt where the interactive contract requires one |
| Tool events | Start from a raw/spec-shaped unfamiliar tool with required title, optional category absent, and structured input. Split later descriptor and output/error deltas from a status-only completion/failure; preserve the accumulated fields, original start time, title, and call ID across the CLI, wire, and app model. | Harmless unfamiliar/native tool has a meaningful activity label and paired completion |
| App rendering | Normalize and reduce the real wire shape; prove compact and expanded generic views prefer authoritative provider text without a `knownTools` entry | Tool call is readable on the supported app surface |

Provider integration tests that inject an already-normalized `AgentMessage` do
not satisfy the raw-event row. Permission tests that stop after constructing
argv do not satisfy the callback row. Keep security-feature approval evidence
separate from test evidence; both are required when the implementation
introduces or expands Happy-owned permission enforcement.

## User-visible change gate

Every user-visible HappyHerd change updates
`server/packages/happy-app/CHANGELOG.md`. Regenerate its checked-in JSON:

```bash
cd server
pnpm --filter happy-app exec tsx sources/scripts/parseChangelog.ts
```

Record the parser-reported latest title and entry count, and review
`sources/changelog/changelog.json`. CI does not currently have a dedicated
Markdown-to-JSON synchronization check, so this evidence is part of review.

## Production proof

```bash
cd server
APP_ENV=production pnpm --filter happy-app exec expo export \
  --platform web --output-dir dist-ci
grep -F '<title>HappyHerd</title>' \
  packages/happy-app/dist-ci/index.html
pnpm --filter happy-app web:smoke
pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli build
pnpm --filter ./packages/happy-server build
```

## Combined post-update runtime acceptance

When an operator intentionally updates both the central server/Web component
and daemon-resident CLI code on a native host, follow
[`playbooks/post-update-restart.md`](playbooks/post-update-restart.md). Runtime
acceptance is ordered and is separate from build or CI proof:

1. deploy and restart the selected server image first;
2. retain local/public `/health`, service start-time, configured-image, and OCI
   revision read-backs;
3. stop, upgrade, and start the daemon as the same host account with the same
   Happy home and environment;
4. compare exact pre/post session IDs and continue one historical session when
   session or recovery behavior changed; and
5. refresh the website and verify the existing machine name, online state, paths,
   and provider catalogs.

An online machine labeled `unknown machine` fails this acceptance. Do not
delete or recreate it: verify the required decrypted metadata shape and use the
authenticated versioned metadata-update owner described in the playbook.

## Full local acceptance

The contract suite requires a clean committed tree, pnpm 10.11.0, ShellCheck,
the recorded upstream lineage tag, and the exact trusted `upstream` remote. It
is an integration gate; it does not build or activate a lockstep release:

```bash
scripts/contract-suite.sh
```

Then run the quality-gate surfaces that the contract suite does not cover:

```bash
cd server
pnpm --filter happy-app i18n:check
APP_ENV=production pnpm --filter happy-app exec expo export \
  --platform web --output-dir dist-ci
grep -F '<title>HappyHerd</title>' packages/happy-app/dist-ci/index.html
pnpm --filter happy-app web:smoke
pnpm --filter @happyherd/cli build
pnpm --filter ./packages/happy-server build
```

Also run `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile` followed by `git diff --exit-code` as
shown above. There is no single local command that reproduces both root CI
workflows.

## Pull-request and post-merge proof planes

A PR is ready to merge only after conversations are resolved and all required
checks pass:

- `Clean install`
- `Lint`
- `Typecheck`
- `Unit tests`
- `Production build`
- `Contract suite`

The root sources of truth are `.github/workflows/quality-gates.yml` and
`.github/workflows/contract-suite.yml`.

After merge, the current pushed `main` SHA must have a successful Quality
workflow, a successful Contract workflow, and both the merged head and merge
commit as ancestors of `origin/main`. This proves the feature permanent and
permits cleanup of its exact PR head. Upstream readiness is intentionally not a
GitHub status check: the machine-local `happyherd-upstream-merge-proposal`
automation evaluates that independent concern and proposes review through
TickTick only when upstream advances.

## Evidence to retain in the PR or handoff

- exact commands run and their outcomes;
- focused behavior proof for the changed invariant;
- generated-file diffs and changelog parser result when applicable;
- all six required PR check conclusions;
- merge SHA, successful Quality and `Contract suite` job evidence;
- merged head SHA, ancestry proof, and exact branch cleanup result.

The native installer workflow runs a four-target build and smoke matrix on pull requests, tags, and manual dispatch; only `happyherd-v*` tags publish. The first prepared stable release is required before the latest installer URL can work. Published-download proof remains separate from PR build and smoke results.

Setting the manual `verify_published` input to `true` on `workflow_dispatch` skips local compilation entirely to fetch and run the latest live public script (`curl ... | sh`) on macOS/Linux arm64/x64 runners to check the published install path.
